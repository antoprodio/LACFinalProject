I grew up surrounded by clothespins, wedding gowns, and tailors. Aka in my family's small business: a dry-cleaners. My parents are both immigrants and both didn't go to college but they always had big dreams of making it in NYC. My dad opened a dry-cleaners in NYC at 25, and then met my mom and his co-owner. For 26 years my dad has been in the dry cleaning business, and although he's amazing at his work, his current website needs a refresh. It's always been a dream of mine to build a website for my father's small business, and to start off that dream I decided to build my dad his dream website for my final project! I hope to continue to improve it as I learn more code!
